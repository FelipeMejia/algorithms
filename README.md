# Algorithms

This repository keeps bite-sized solutions for coding interview problems. Use the index below to jump into any problem directory for write-ups and code.

## LeetCode

| Problem | Category / Pattern | Resources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Merge Sorted Array | Arrays · Two Pointers (reverse fill) | [Notes](leetcode/merge-sorted-array/README.md) · [Python](leetcode/merge-sorted-array/solution.py) |
| Remove Element | Arrays · Two Pointers (slow/fast) | [Notes](leetcode/remove-element/README.md) · [Python](leetcode/remove-element/solution.py) |

Each problem folder contains a short explanation (`README.md`) and its reference implementation (`solution.py`). Add new problems by creating a directory under `leetcode/` with this structure, then register it in the table above.
